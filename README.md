# PBS KIDS Robo Workshop

Hello!! Welcome to my Intern project for the PBS KIDS Games Squad! (๑˃ᴗ˂)ﻭ
This game is created in collaboration with Georgia Oldham, the PBS KIDS Creative Intern. She is responsible for creating all of its lovely assets!

Robo Workshop is targeted at young children, ~ages 3-7. The learning goals are STEAM-focused and include topics such as understanding basic shapes and colors, creative thinking and expression, and basic arithmetic and problem-solving skills.

This game was developed using the Springroll Seed and Pixi.js. 


## Build Your Own Bot 
Currently in progress! This game mode gives users full creative agency over the bot creation process. 


## Robot Puzzle
This game mode has yet to be developed. It will guide players through simple prompts to select each of the robot's parts. However, there is still room for creative expression along with these prompts!


__Note__ I want to give a huge thank you to the PBS KIDS Game Squad for all the support and guidance they've given me along the way! In addition to the Games Squad, I want to thank the PBS KIDS product & technology, design, and content teams for their continued support of our project. And, most importantly, this game is made possible thanks to viewers like you!
